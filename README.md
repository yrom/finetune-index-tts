# IndexTTS Fine-tuning Demo

[中文说明](README_zh.md)

This project is a demonstration of fine-tuning [IndexTTS](https://github.com/index-tts/index-tts) to generate speech with addtional special tags (such as `<GIGGLES>`), enabling the synthesis of non-textual elements like laughter.

## Goals

- Show you how to fine-tune IndexTTS's text Tokenizer (BPE) and AR part (GPT2).
- Support for addtional special tags like `<GIGGLES>` in text to generate laughter.

### Fine-tuning Experiment Results Example

| Reference Audio | Text | Synthesized Speech |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Female-1][Female_1]| Seriously? &lt;giggles> That's the cutest thing I've ever heard! | [Synthesized Speech](samples/Female-1_SeriouslygigglesThatsthecutestt.wav) |
| [Female-1][Female_1] | 真的吗？ &lt;giggles> 这也太可爱了吧！| [Synthesized Speech](samples/Female-1_真的吗giggles这也太可爱了吧.wav) |
| [Male-1][Male_1]| Wha—? Cute? &lt;giggles> You think I'm cute?! Well, uh, thanks, I guess? | [Synthesized Speech](samples/Male-1_Wha—CutegigglesYouthinkImcute.wav) |
| [Male-1][Male_1]| 哎呀! 忘了他还在那等我们呢！&lt;giggles> 我们两个动作得快点了！| [Synthesized Speech](samples/Male-1_哎呀忘了他还在那等我们呢giggles我们两个动作得快点了.wav) |

### Modules Fine-tuned in This Project

- **BPE**: Actually `sentencepiece`, this project implements adding new special tags such as `<GIGGLES>`
- **GPT2**: The autoregressive model part, using the `peft` library for `LoRA` fine-tuning, supporting the generation of speech latents for text with special tags
